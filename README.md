This [prem notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/terrydolan/prem/blob/master/prem-analysis.ipynb) demonstrates the power of IPython Notebook, python, pandas and matplotlib to analyse a data set. The data set I am using is the English premiership league 2014-15 football match results as of 27th April 2015.

See [Terry's blog about prem](http://terrydolan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/premier-league-2014-15-football-match.html) for more information.
